# About

This project is a C++ prompt-based, multithreaded game engine that not only offers high-performance and flexibility but also integrates AI assistance. Developers can easily write their own game logic, and the AI helps generate or optimize code, making game development more intuitive and efficient. It's designed to support complex gameplay mechanics and multithreaded execution for optimized performance.
